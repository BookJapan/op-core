	I think so this is the main use of the database.
	Point of this usage, to be used only single match, such as ID.
 	
 	//  get single value of column.
 	$nickname = $this->pdo()->quick("nickname <- host.database.table.id = $id");
 	
 	//  get many value of column.
 	list( $nickname, $comment ) = $this->pdo()->quick("nickname,comment <- host.database.table.id = $id");
 	
 	//  select a record.
 	$record = $this->pdo()->quick("host.database.table.id = $id");

	//  select all records.
	$config->limit = -1;
 	$records = $this->pdo()->quick("host.database.table.id = $id",$config);
